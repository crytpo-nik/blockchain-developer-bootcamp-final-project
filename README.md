# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project
a new way to redistribute NFTs through a process that will benefit all participants involved(buyers, sellers &amp; platform). this platform is managed by DAO to be completely decentralized and  and powered by DEFI to make the game theory behind it complete.

this will be tow token platform. one is used for governance and one is used to participate in the auctions.

the role of governance will be choosing which NFTs will be  buyed from market using treasury assets and puted for sale in auction.

second token will be used to bid on the auctions and can be buyed from open market or earned through liquidity mining programms.

the auction mechanisem is ass follow:

  - the floor price, starting time & end time is have to be set.
  - each bid will add the end time by t seconds.(small amount)
  - each bid  will increase the price by x amount( very small amount)
  - when the timer ends,  the last bidder is the winner. the winner gets a request to sign a transaction and pay the price an d gets the NFT.
