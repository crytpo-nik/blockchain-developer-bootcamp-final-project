# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project
a new way to redistribute NFTs through a process that will benefit all participants involved(buyers, sellers &amp; platform). this platform is managed by DAO to be completely decentralized and  and powered by DEFI to make the game theory behind it complete.

this will be tow token platform. one is used for governance and one is used to participate in the auctions.

the role of governance will be choosing which NFTs will be  buyed from market using treasury assets and puted for sale in auction.

second token will be used to bid on the auctions and can be buyed from open market or earned through liquidity mining programms.

the auction mechanisem is ass follow:

  - the floor price, starting time & end time is have to be set.
  - each bid will add the end time by t seconds.(small amount)
  - each bid  will increase the price by x amount( very small amount)
  - when the timer ends,  the last bidder is the winner. the winner gets a request to sign a transaction and gets the NFT.
  - auction has also a cap price(priced in token1) that has to be in a lock till the winner wins and all aother participants get they money back. 

 the user workflow can be  sepereatly explained for user1 and user2.
 user1: user who participated on voting.
 user2: user who not partipated on voting.

user1 workflow will have the following steps:
  - user signs in by web3 wallet
  - user can see and vote on the NFT to be buyed and getting auctioned(in voting no matter the amount of tokens, anyone has the same power)
  - when voting is done the NFT will be bought from market and getting auctioned.
  - each user locks an amount that is needed and gets an amount of token2.
  - auction begins and each user starts to bid,after each bid tiemline and price getting updated.


user2 workflow will have the following steps:

  - user sees the auctions availbale.
  - user pays min amount and and buys token2.
  - user particpates in auction.
